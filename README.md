## 📌 Business Insights

### 📉 Mid-Year Sales Decline
- Sales experienced a noticeable decline during **April to July**
- These months underperformed compared to the rest of the year
- Indicates potential seasonality, pricing issues, or reduced market demand
- Suggests need for mid-year promotional campaigns or cost optimization

---

### 🏙 Revenue Concentration in Key Cities
- **Los Angeles, New York, Atlanta, San Francisco, and Seattle** consistently generated the highest revenue
- These cities contribute a significant percentage of total sales
- Sales are geographically concentrated, increasing dependency risk

✔ **Recommendation:**  
Proceed with focused marketing efforts in these cities while exploring growth opportunities in underperforming regions.

---

### 🧾 Product Revenue Dependency
- A small group of **Top N products contributes a large share of total revenue**
- Bottom products generate minimal revenue but add operational complexity
- Indicates a classic **Pareto (80/20) pattern**

✔ **Recommendation:**  
Prioritize inventory, promotions, and forecasting for top-performing products while reviewing the viability of low-performing ones.

---
### ⚖ Risk & Opportunity Analysis
- Heavy reliance on top products and cities increases business risk
- Bottom products and cities present opportunities for optimization or elimination
- Dynamic Top/Bottom N analysis allows management to simulate different scenarios
